AcmeVPN is operated by Acme Networks, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as "we," "the Company," or "AcmeVPN"). This Privacy Policy applies to all services we provide and aims to comply with major global data protection regulations.
AcmeVPN focuses on providing network acceleration and internet privacy protection services, always prioritizing user data security. This Privacy Policy aims to detail how AcmeVPN collects, uses, shares, protects, and transfers user data across borders, clearly distinguishing the differences in data processing between our website and client software, and explaining user rights in different jurisdictions.

- We regularly review collected data to ensure its continued necessity, and unnecessary data shall be promptly deleted or anonymized;
- We regularly conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA).

## 4. Data Collection Policy
When you use the AcmeVPN website or client, your internet data shall be protected through advanced encryption technology. Your online traffic shall be invisible to Internet Service Providers (ISPs), third-party eavesdroppers, and unauthorized third parties.

### 4.1 No-Log Policy Commitment
AcmeVPN strictly adheres to a no-log policy. Our no-log policy means that during your use of VPN services, we do not collect, record, or store any data that can be used to identify or trace individual user identity or reconstruct user online activities, including:
- Domain names and target IP addresses you access through VPN services;
- DNS query records;
- Connection timestamps and session duration;
- Traffic destinations and data transmission content;
- For European users, we also commit under GDPR provisions not to establish identifiable user activity databases.

**Important Notice**:
Our no-log policy applies to the VPN service itself. For website or client operational security purposes, we still collect limited website/client access log information, which is technically and scope-wise strictly separated from VPN usage logs.

### 4.2 Necessary Technical Data Collection
To maintain service quality, security, and performance optimization, we only collect the following necessary anonymous technical data. Such data consists entirely of aggregated anonymous statistical information that does not involve user personal identity or specific online activities, including:
#### 4.2.1 VPN Service-Related Data
- Traffic Statistics: Account-level cumulative traffic statistics (not associated with specific time or content);
- Device Connection Count: Number of simultaneously connected devices (used to enforce service plan limits);
- Server Performance Metrics: Server performance data such as server load, bandwidth usage, source IP address country or region (used only to recommend optimal server locations or perform route optimization, completely anonymized, not associated with specific users, and not used for profiling or automated decision-making);
- Application Stability Data: Application crash reports and error diagnostic information (containing no personal data).

#### 4.2.2 Website/Client Access Logs
- Access Time: Used for website performance analysis and security auditing;
- Browser Information: Used to ensure website compatibility and optimize user experience;
- Accessed Pages: Used to improve website structure and content;

**Important Notice**:
- Access logs are completely separated from VPN service usage logs technically and in scope;
- Access source information shall not be associated with your activities during VPN usage;
- Access logs undergo anonymization processing promptly after collection;
- Access logs are retained for no more than 30 days and are automatically deleted or anonymized upon expiration.

### 4.3 Anti-Abuse Measures
We implement the following measures to prevent service abuse, which do not affect your privacy:
- Device connection quantity limits;
- Abnormal traffic pattern detection (based on anonymous statistics);
- Technical indicator monitoring of account usage (such as concurrent connections, abnormal request frequency), not involving content-level data.
We may collaborate with third-party security service providers (e.g., DDoS protection services) for protection, but shall not share identifiable user activity data. Third-party service providers can only access necessary anonymous technical data.
