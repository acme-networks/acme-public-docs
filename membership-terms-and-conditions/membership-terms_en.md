## Preamble
Welcome to AcmeVPN!

To ensure that you fully understand our membership service rules, we have established these detailed terms. Please carefully read and understand the relevant provisions to better utilize our services.

**Important Notice**: Using AcmeVPN membership services constitutes acknowledgment that you have read, understood, and agree to comply with these membership terms.

## 0. Definitions
To avoid ambiguity, the terms in these terms of service have the following meanings:
- **Membership Types**: Include paid memberships (SVIP, VIP) and free memberships (free trial, Basic membership, referral reward VIP).
- **VIP**: Basic paid membership benefits. Referral reward VIP enjoys the same benefits as paid VIP.
- **SVIP**: Premium paid membership benefits, offering faster speeds and more device connections than VIP.
- **Basic Membership**: Free membership obtained through advertisements or activities, with features below VIP level.
- **Free Trial**: 3-day free experience available to new users upon first registration, limited to once per user.
- **Purchase Methods**:
  - Subscription Purchase: Billing through third-party payment platforms (such as Stripe) on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis;
  - One-time Purchase: Single payment for a fixed-term membership benefit.
- **Validity Period Calculation**: Service validity period is calculated continuously from the actual effective moment of the benefits. The "day" or "days" mentioned in these membership terms of service refer to 24-hour units calculated continuously from the effective moment, not natural days.

## 1. Membership Top-up Methods
You can purchase membership services for your AcmeVPN account through the following methods:
- **Free Trial**: New users can enjoy 3 days of free experience after first registration.
- **Subscription Purchase**: You can choose to purchase VIP or SVIP membership on a monthly, quarterly, or annual cycle.
- **One-time Purchase**: You can make a single purchase for a fixed-term VIP or SVIP membership service.
- **Referral Rewards**: After successfully referring new users who register and make their first top-up, you can receive additional membership duration as a reward. For specific rules, please refer to the invite friends page.

## 2. Membership Validity Period
### 2.1 Paid Membership Validity Period
AcmeVPN provides monthly, quarterly, and annual paid membership services. The validity period of each service is calculated continuously from the effective moment, being 31×24 hours, 93×24 hours, and 372×24 hours respectively, not based on natural days.

**Calculation Example**: If you purchase a monthly VIP membership at Singapore Standard Time 8:00 AM on February 1, 2025, the membership will expire after 31×24 hours, i.e., at Singapore Standard Time 8:00 AM on March 4, 2025.

### 2.2 Free Reward Membership Validity Period
**Basic Membership**:
- The validity period is calculated continuously for 24 hours from the moment the user successfully redeems it;
- **Example**: If you redeem a 1-day Basic membership at Singapore Standard Time 2:00 PM on February 1, 2025, the validity period ends at 2:00 PM on February 2, 2025.

**Referral Reward VIP**:
- The validity period is calculated continuously for 24 hours from the moment the user receives the reward (or corresponding multiples for rewards of longer duration);
- **Example**: If you receive a 1-day referral reward VIP at Singapore Standard Time 2:00 PM on February 1, 2025, the validity period ends at 2:00 PM on February 2, 2025.

### 2.3 Subscription Payment Processing
The deduction date for subscription payments is subject to the rules of the payment platform (such as Stripe); however, membership validity periods are calculated according to these terms.

### 2.4 Time Zone Calculation Rules
The validity period of all membership services (including paid and free memberships) is based on the time zone where the user obtained/redeemed/purchased the service, calculated continuously in hours from that moment.

## 3. Membership Levels and Types
### 3.1 Paid Membership Levels
AcmeVPN offers two types of paid membership services:
| Membership Level | Service Description | Device Connection Limit |

### 3.3 Membership Benefits Description
To avoid inconsistencies due to untimely updates of these terms, the specific benefits, functions, and usage restrictions of memberships shall be subject to the latest descriptions on AcmeVPN product pages. In case of discrepancies between product pages and this agreement, the product page descriptions shall take priority, but this does not affect the overall validity of this agreement.

## 4. Refund Policy

### 4.1 Refund Terms
- Given that we have provided 3 days of free VIP membership experience service for every new user, allowing you to fully experience and evaluate service quality before payment, and considering that this membership service is a digital service where purchase constitutes activation of related services, except for legally mandated circumstances (such as failure to actually provide services due to our reasons, major service defects, erroneous charges, etc.), all paid membership services, once effective, are non-refundable.
- For automatic renewals, you can enter the "My Membership" page at any time and click "Manage Membership" to jump to third-party payment platforms (such as Stripe) for cancellation. No new charges will occur after cancellation.
- After canceling automatic renewal, you can continue to use our services until the end of the current service billing cycle, but unused portions of subscription fees within the current service billing cycle will not be refunded.

### 4.2 Free Trial Recommendations
We recommend that you fully experience the following during the free trial period:
- Server connection speed and stability testing;
- Application functionality and interface experience;
- Whether the service meets your usage needs;
- If you have questions, you can contact us through the help center on AcmeVPN's website or app, or by sending an email to support@acmevpn.io.

## 5. Free Trial Rules
- Free trial is limited to new users once only and becomes invalid immediately when users begin subscription purchases or one-time purchases of paid memberships. Therefore, once you begin subscription purchases or one-time purchases of paid memberships, the free trial will automatically end and cannot be restored.
- Deleting accounts and re-registering does not entitle users to additional trial services.
- Users should fully evaluate service quality and usage needs during the trial period.
- If our company subsequently launches other membership gifting services, specific benefits and applicable rules shall be subject to the activity terms officially published by our company at that time and shall constitute a supplement to these membership terms of service.

## 6. Membership Stacking and Priority

### 6.1 Basic Principle
Only one membership service is effective at the same time.

### 6.2 Priority Order
Remaining service duration for the same type of membership (such as multiple SVIP or multiple VIP) will be automatically combined for use.
Different types of memberships will automatically take effect according to the following priority order:
1. **SVIP Membership** (paid SVIP)
2. **VIP Membership** (including paid VIP and referral reward VIP)
3. **Basic Membership**

#### 6.3 Membership Upgrade/Downgrade Rules
#### 6.3.1 Membership Upgrade Rules
- Users can upgrade their current subscription purchase services by paying the corresponding price difference (upgrade rules do not apply to one-time purchased membership services). Upgrades are divided into the following two categories:
  - Type Upgrade (VIP → SVIP, same or longer duration)
    1. Monthly VIP → Monthly/Quarterly/Annual SVIP
    2. Quarterly VIP → Quarterly/Annual SVIP
    3. Annual VIP → Annual SVIP
  - Duration Upgrade (same type, subscription duration extension)
    1. Monthly VIP → Quarterly/Annual VIP
    2. Quarterly VIP → Annual VIP
    3. Monthly SVIP → Quarterly/Annual SVIP
    4. Quarterly SVIP → Annual SVIP

- After upgrade completion, users immediately enjoy upgraded service benefits. However, the start time for service validity period calculation remains the original subscription start time and does not change due to upgrades.

- Example: If a user subscribes to monthly VIP at Singapore Standard Time 10:00 AM on January 1 and upgrades to monthly SVIP at 3:00 PM on January 3, the user will enjoy monthly SVIP benefits from 3:00 PM on January 3, but their subscription service cycle still starts from 10:00 AM on January 1, with termination time at 10:00 AM on February 1.

#### 6.3.2 Membership Downgrade Rules
- If users simultaneously have different types of subscription services, downgrades will take effect after the current billing cycle ends. That is, after downgrading, lower-priority subscription services will automatically take effect after higher-priority subscription services expire.

## 7. Usage Rules and Restrictions
- Once membership service validity period begins, it cannot be suspended or extended except in circumstances explicitly provided by law or these terms.
- Membership services are not affected by user usage frequency or login status. If you delete your account, uninstall AcmeVPN, or do not use membership services during the membership validity period, the membership service remains in normal use status.
- Membership qualifications cannot be transferred or shared with other users. If the system detects sharing behavior or other abnormal usage behavior in an account, AcmeVPN has the right to ban users and terminate membership services.
- Users must not fraudulently obtain Basic membership services through malicious farming or other behaviors. If the system detects malicious farming or other malicious behaviors in an account, AcmeVPN has the right to warn users, restrict functions, suspend services, ban accounts, and terminate membership services.

## 8. Terms Modification and Interpretation
### 8.1 Terms Changes and Notification
We reserve the right to modify these terms within the scope permitted by law. In case of major changes, we will notify you in advance through email, in-app notifications, or website announcements. Modified terms take effect from the date of publication. We recommend that you regularly review these terms to understand the latest information.

### 8.2 Terms Relationship
These membership terms of service are a supplementary document to AcmeVPN's "Terms of Service." In case of conflicts or matters not covered by these membership terms of service, the "Terms of Service" shall prevail. For matters regarding legal application and dispute resolution, please refer to relevant provisions in Chapter 10 of the "Terms of Service."
