If there is any discrepancy between the product pages and these Membership Terms, the product page shall prevail, without affecting the overall validity of these Membership Terms.

## 4. Refund Policy

### 4.1 Refund Terms
- Since all new users are offered a 3-day free VIP trial to fully experience and evaluate service quality prior to payment, and as membership services constitute digital services which are deemed activated upon purchase, all paid membership services are non-refundable once effective, except as required by applicable law (e.g., failure to provide services due to our reasons, material service defects, erroneous charges, etc.);
- You may cancel auto-renewal at any time by clicking "Manage Membership" on the "My Membership" page, which links to a third-party payment platform (e.g., Stripe). Once canceled, no further charges will be incurred;
- After canceling auto-renewal, you may continue to use the services until the end of the current billing cycle, however, fees for unused portions of the current billing cycle will not be refunded.

### 4.2 Free Trial Recommendations
During your free trial, we recommend that you:
- Test server connection speed and stability;
- Evaluate application functionality and interface experience;
- Determine whether the service meets your usage needs;
- If you have questions, please contact us through the help center on AcmeVPN website or app, or send an email to support@acmevpn.io.

## 5. Free Trial Rules
- Free trials are limited to new users once only and terminate immediately upon commencement of any subscription purchases or one-time purchases of paid memberships. Therefore, once you begin a subscription purchase or one-time purchase of paid memberships, the free trial will automatically end and cannot be restored;
- Deleting accounts and re-registering does not entitle a user to an additional free trial;
- Users are expected to fully evaluate service quality and usage needs during the trial period;
- If AcmeVPN subsequently offers additional membership promotions, the specific benefits and applicable conditions shall be subject to the activity terms officially published by our company and shall be deemed a supplement to these Membership Terms.

## 6. Membership Stacking and Priority

### 6.1 General Principle
Only one membership service may be active at any given time.

### 6.2 Priority Order
Remaining time for the same type of membership (e.g., multiple SVIPs or multiple VIPs) will be automatically combined for use.
Different types of memberships will take effect in the following order of priority:
1. **SVIP Membership** (paid SVIP)
2. **VIP Membership** (including paid VIP and Referral Reward VIP)
3. **Basic Membership**

#### 6.3 Upgrade and Downgrade Rules
#### 6.3.1 Upgrade Rules
- Users may upgrade their current subscription purchase by paying the corresponding price difference (these upgrade rules do not apply to one-time purchases). Upgrades are divided into the following two categories:
  - Type Upgrade (VIP → SVIP, same or longer duration)
    1. Monthly VIP → Monthly/Quarterly/Annual SVIP
    2. Quarterly VIP → Quarterly/Annual SVIP
    3. Annual VIP → Annual SVIP
  - Duration Upgrade (same type, longer duration)
    1. Monthly VIP → Quarterly/Annual VIP
    2. Quarterly VIP → Annual VIP
    3. Monthly SVIP → Quarterly/Annual SVIP
    4. Quarterly SVIP → Annual SVIP
- Upon upgrade, users enjoy upgraded service benefits immediately. However, the validity period of services shall remain based on the start time of the original subscription and shall not be reset.
- **Example**: If a user subscribes to monthly VIP at 10:00 AM (Singapore Standard Time) on January 1 and upgrades to monthly SVIP at 3:00 PM on January 3, the user enjoys monthly SVIP benefits from 3:00 PM on January 3, but the service period of the subscription service remains January 1, 10:00 AM through February 1, 10:00 AM.
#### 6.3.2 Downgrade Rules
- If a user holds multiple subscriptions of different types, downgrades shall take effect only after the current billing cycle ends. Lower-priority subscription services shall automatically take effect upon the expiration of higher-priority subscription services.

## 7. Usage Rules and Restrictions
- Once a membership validity period begins, it cannot be suspended or extended except as expressly provided by law or these Membership Terms;
- Membership services remain effective regardless of usage frequency or login status. If you delete your account, uninstall AcmeVPN, or fail to use membership services during the membership validity period, the membership service remains active;
- Membership benefits are non-transferable and may not be shared with others. If an account sharing or other abnormal usage is detected, AcmeVPN reserves the right to ban accounts or terminate membership services;
- Users must not obtain Basic membership fraudulently through malicious practices. If such malicious practices or other malicious conduct are detected, AcmeVPN reserves the right to issue warnings, restrict functions, suspend services, ban accounts, or terminate membership services.

### 8. Terms Modification and Interpretation

### 8.1 Terms Changes and Notification

You are encouraged to review these Membership Terms periodically.

### 8.2 Terms Relationship
These Membership Terms are a supplementary document to AcmeVPN's Terms of Service. In case of conflicts or where these Membership Terms are silent, the Terms of Service shall prevail.
