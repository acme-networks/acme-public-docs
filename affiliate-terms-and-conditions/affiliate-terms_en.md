## 1. Affiliate Program Overview

### 1.1 Program Introduction
This Affiliate Program is a performance-based cooperation project. Affiliate Members can earn corresponding commission rewards after successfully guiding new users to register and pay for AcmeVPN's membership services (including VIP and SVIP) through their Exclusive Affiliate Links.

### 1.2 Cooperation Principles
This Affiliate Program operates based on the principles of legality, integrity, equality, and mutual benefit. Affiliate Members shall ensure that their promotional activities comply with applicable laws and these Terms. Any violations of law or these Terms will result in termination of cooperation.

## 2. Application Eligibility and Requirements

### 2.1 Basic Eligibility
To apply to become an Affiliate Member or participate in the Affiliate Program, the following conditions must be met:
- Be at least 18 years old with full legal capacity;
- Own legal and valid promotional channels (websites, blogs, social media accounts, etc.);
- Promotional content must comply with laws and regulations and social public order and morality;
- Possess legal and valid payment collection accounts for receiving commission rewards.

### 2.2 Prohibited Conditions
Applicants with the following circumstances may not apply to become Affiliate Members or participate in the Affiliate Program:
- Individuals or organizations engaged in illegal or irregular activities;
- Promotional channels involving pornography, violence, gambling, fraud, or other content;
- Those previously expelled by the Company or other affiliate programs;
- VPN service providers who directly compete with AcmeVPN or their employees;
- Individuals or organizations involved in money laundering, terrorist organizations, or other activities violating international sanctions.

### 2.3 Geographic Restrictions
Based on legal compliance and commercial considerations, we currently do not accept applicants from the following countries or regions:
- Countries or regions subject to international sanctions;
- Countries or regions where local laws explicitly prohibit VPN service promotion or affiliate marketing activities;
- Areas identified as high political or economic risk.

AcmeVPN reserves the right to adjust the restriction list according to changes in legal policies. Applicants or Affiliate Members are prohibited from circumventing geographic restrictions through false addresses, proxy addresses, or other means. Otherwise, we reserve the right to immediately terminate cooperation, clear account balances, and recover all paid commissions (if any).

### 2.4 Application Process
Applicants interested in joining the Affiliate Program should visit the affiliate program page on the AcmeVPN official website, apply using their personal email address, and submit the following materials or information:
- Basic information and contact details of the individual or organization;
- Introduction to promotional channels (website links, social media accounts, etc.);
- Expected promotional plan and strategy description;
- Payment collection account information.

We will review the authenticity and accuracy of the aforementioned materials before commission withdrawals. Affiliate Members who pass the review will receive commissions according to the commission withdrawal process; those who do not pass may be required to submit supplementary materials for clarification. If supplementary materials still fail to pass review, we reserve the right to refuse to distribute corresponding commissions.

## 3. Commission Structure and Incentive Mechanism

### 3.1 Basic Commission
- When new users who registered through your Exclusive Affiliate Link successfully purchase paid membership services for the first time, you can receive 40% of the actual payment amount for that order as commission (i.e., "First Payment Commission");
- For subsequent renewal orders from that user, you can receive 36% of the actual payment amount for the order as commission (i.e., "Renewal Commission");
- All commissions are calculated based on users' actual payment amounts. That is, when users use promotional codes, coupons, or receive price reductions through discount activities, commissions are calculated based on the actual payment amount after reduction. For example, if a new user uses a 20% discount to purchase a package originally priced at $100, their actual payment amount is $80, and the Affiliate Member receives $32 as First Payment Commission ($80 × 40%).

### 3.2 Monthly Performance Incentives
To motivate excellent Affiliate Members, we have established a Monthly Performance Incentive mechanism. Based on the number of Valid Orders successfully promoted in the current month, eligible Affiliate Members can enjoy corresponding additional commission rewards in the following month.

#### 3.2.1 Statistical Period
The statistical period for Monthly Performance Incentives is from 00:00 to 23:59 on the last day of the month in Singapore Standard Time, with statistics based on order generation time.

#### 3.2.2 Incentive Implementation Rules

| Current Month Valid Orders | Next Month Additional Commission |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 50-99 orders | Additional +2.5% |
| 100-149 orders | Additional +5% | 
| 150-199 orders | Additional +7.5% | 
| 200 orders and above | Additional +10% | 

**Example**: If you successfully promote 100 Valid Orders in January, all confirmed commissions in February will receive an additional 5% on top of the basic commission calculation, for example:
- First Payment Commission becomes 45% of users' actual payment amount (basic 40% + incentive 5%);
- Renewal Commission becomes 41% of users' actual payment amount (basic 36% + incentive 5%).

**Important Note**: Performance incentives are calculated based on all confirmed commissions in the following month and cannot be accumulated or transferred across months.

### 3.3 Tracking and Attribution Mechanism
- The promotional tracking period is 30 days from the user's first valid click. The attribution relationship after user account registration will be determined by the system based on invitation code information and other relevant technical identification methods;
- If new users complete their first payment within the tracking period, attribution to that Affiliate Member is confirmed;
- First payments beyond the tracking period do not generate commission attribution;
- Once attribution is confirmed, that user's renewal orders will continue to be attributed to that Affiliate Member;
- Only new users who first register for AcmeVPN accounts through Affiliate Members' Exclusive Affiliate Links qualify for commission calculation;
- The system will identify new and existing users through email addresses, device fingerprints, and other technical means to prevent duplicate calculations.

### 3.4 Commission Billing Scope
Only paid membership service items (VIP, SVIP) purchased by users are included in the commission billing scope; paid item orders for non-membership services or refund orders are not included in the commission billing scope.
