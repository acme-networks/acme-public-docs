### Senior Full Stack Software Engineer

**Location**: San Francisco, Toronto
**Employment**: Full-time

### About the Role
We are looking for Senior Full Stack Software Engineers to build and scale user-facing products across web and mobile, and high-performance backend services. You will work across the stack to deliver fast, reliable, and secure experiences. You will partner closely with product, design, and engineering peers to shape the architecture, quality bar, and team culture.

### What You Will Do
- Design, build, and operate backend services in Rust with a focus on performance, reliability, and security.
- Deliver delightful, accessible, and responsive web experiences using React and TypeScript.
- Build and ship cross-platform mobile apps with Flutter (iOS and Android), delivering smooth UX and robust state management.
- Define and evolve system architecture, APIs, data models, and integration patterns across platforms.
- Own features end-to-end: technical discovery, implementation, testing, observability, rollout, and post-launch iteration.
- Raise the engineering bar through code reviews, design docs/RFCs, pairing, and continuous improvement.
- Introduce best practices for performance, testing, security, and developer experience (DX).
- Mentor engineers, lead projects, and collaborate across disciplines.

### What You Bring
- 5+ years of professional software engineering experience, including end-to-end product ownership.
- Proven experience delivering both client-side (web and/or mobile) and server-side software in production; comfortable working across the stack.
- Hands-on experience designing and operating production-grade services (e.g., REST/gRPC/GraphQL APIs, auth, rate limiting, caching).
- Fluency with modern web frontend engineering: component-driven development, JavaScript/TypeScript, performance profiling, and accessibility; experience with one or more frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte, Angular).
- Experience with at least one modern backend language and ecosystem (e.g., Rust, Go, Java/Kotlin, Node.js/TypeScript, Python).
- Solid grasp of data modeling and storage (PostgreSQL/MySQL, Redis) and event-driven systems (e.g., Kafka/PubSub) where applicable.
- Strong testing mindset and practice (unit, integration, contract, end-to-end) and familiarity with feature flags and safe rollouts.
- Experience with cloud environments (AWS/GCP/Azure), containers, orchestration (Kubernetes), and CI/CD.
- Security-first thinking and familiarity with secure coding practices (OAuth/OIDC, JWT, secrets management, least privilege).
- Excellent communication, ownership, and a bias for action in ambiguous, fast-moving environments.

### Nice to Have
- Deep Rust experience with async runtimes (Tokio), frameworks (Axum/Actix), and data layers (SQLx/Diesel).
- Web platform depth: Next.js, Vite, TanStack Router/Query, CSS-in-JS or utility-first CSS, Web Vitals optimization.
- Mobile depth: Flutter performance tuning, platform channels, native modules, build pipelines, Firebase; experience shipping to iOS/Android/macOS/Windows.
- Observability: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus/Grafana, Sentry, Datadog; pragmatic on-call and SLO mentality.
- Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform/Pulumi), networking fundamentals, zero-downtime migrations.
- Prior experience in high-scale, low-latency systems, fintech/health/privacy domains, or compliance-heavy environments.
- Meaningful open-source contributions or technical writing/talks.

### How We Work
- Product-minded engineering: we start with user problems, iterate quickly, and measure outcomes.
- Engineering excellence: clear APIs and contracts, design docs before complex work, code reviews focused on clarity and maintainability.
- Security and privacy by design: threat modeling, least-privilege defaults, automated checks in CI, and regular reviews.
- Pragmatism: choose the simplest approach that can scale; optimize for developer velocity and long-term maintainability.

### Compensation & Benefits
- Competitive salary and meaningful equity (RSUs/stock options).
- Comprehensive health, dental, and vision coverage; mental health support.
- Flexible time off and paid parental leave.
- Top-tier tooling and ergonomic workspace support.
- Annual learning budget and dedicated time for professional development.

### Equal Opportunity
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We are committed to providing reasonable accommodations for candidates with disabilities throughout the interview process.
