### Senior Backend Software Engineer

**Location**: San Francisco, Toronto
**Employment**: Full-time

### About the Role
We are looking for Senior Backend Software Engineers to design, build, and operate high-performance backend services in Rust. You will shape resilient, secure, and observable systems that power user-facing products across web and mobile. You will partner closely with product, design, and engineering peers to influence architecture, raise the quality bar, and evolve team culture.

### What You Will Do
- Design, build, and operate backend services in Rust with a focus on performance, reliability, and security.
- Define and evolve system architecture, service boundaries, APIs, data models, and integration patterns across platforms.
- Build production-grade APIs (REST/gRPC/GraphQL), including authentication/authorization, rate limiting, and caching.
- Own services end-to-end: technical discovery, implementation, testing, observability, rollout, and post-launch iteration.
- Develop robust data layers using PostgreSQL/MySQL and Redis; drive schema design, migrations, and data access patterns.
- Establish SLOs, instrumentation, and on-call best practices; lead incident response and drive post-incident improvements.
- Improve developer experience and platform reliability through CI/CD enhancements, automation, and runtime tuning.
- Mentor engineers, lead projects, and collaborate across disciplines.

### What You Bring
- 5+ years of professional software engineering experience, with a strong track record operating backend services in production.
- Fluency with Rust and its async ecosystem; strong grasp of concurrency, performance profiling, and memory safety.
- Hands-on experience designing and operating production-grade services (e.g., REST/gRPC/GraphQL APIs, auth, rate limiting, caching).
- Solid data modeling and storage expertise (PostgreSQL/MySQL, Redis) and familiarity with event-driven systems where applicable.
- Strong testing mindset and practice (unit, integration, contract, end-to-end) and familiarity with feature flags and safe rollouts.
- Experience with cloud environments (AWS/GCP/Azure), containers, orchestration (Kubernetes), and CI/CD.
- Security-first thinking and familiarity with secure coding practices (OAuth/OIDC, JWT, secrets management, least privilege).
- Excellent communication, ownership, and a bias for action in ambiguous, fast-moving environments.

### Nice to Have
- Deep Rust experience with async runtimes (Tokio), frameworks (Axum/Actix), and data layers (SQLx/Diesel).
- Observability: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus/Grafana, Sentry, Datadog; pragmatic on-call and SLO mentality.
- Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform/Pulumi), networking fundamentals, zero-downtime migrations.
- Prior experience in high-scale, low-latency systems, fintech/health/privacy domains, or compliance-heavy environments.
- Meaningful open-source contributions or technical writing/talks.

### How We Work
- Product-minded engineering: we start with user problems, iterate quickly, and measure outcomes.
- Engineering excellence: clear APIs and contracts, design docs before complex work, code reviews focused on clarity and maintainability.
- Security and privacy by design: threat modeling, least-privilege defaults, automated checks in CI, and regular reviews.
- Pragmatism: choose the simplest approach that can scale; optimize for developer velocity and long-term maintainability.

### Compensation & Benefits
- Competitive salary and meaningful equity (RSUs/stock options).
- Comprehensive health, dental, and vision coverage; mental health support.
- Flexible time off and paid parental leave.
- Top-tier tooling and ergonomic workspace support.
- Annual learning budget and dedicated time for professional development.

### Equal Opportunity
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We are committed to providing reasonable accommodations for candidates with disabilities throughout the interview process.
