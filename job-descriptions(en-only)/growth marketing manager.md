### Growth Marketing Manager

**Location**: Toronto
**Employment**: Full-time

### About the Role
We are looking for Growth Marketing Managers to design and execute our full-funnel growth strategy across acquisition, activation, retention, and revenue. You will own experiments, channels, measurement, and insights that move the business. You will partner closely with product, design, engineering, data, and sales to build scalable growth loops, deliver high-quality programs, and raise the bar on analytics and execution.

### What You Will Do
- Own end-to-end growth strategy and operating cadence across the funnel; define OKRs, measurement plans, and guardrail metrics.
- Plan, launch, and optimize multi-channel acquisition: paid search/social, display/video, Apple Search Ads, affiliates/partners, and referrals.
- Drive organic growth via SEO/ASO, content distribution, and conversion-focused landing pages; collaborate with design and web to ship fast.
- Build lifecycle programs using modern CRM tools; design segmentation, journeys, and personalization.
- Lead experimentation and incrementality testing; establish clear hypotheses, sample sizing, and statistical rigor.
- Implement and maintain a reliable analytics and attribution stack; own the tracking plan and data quality.
- Model growth economics and forecast channel spend; allocate budgets for efficiency and scale.
- Partner with product and engineering to ship growth features and loops, leveraging feature flags and holdouts.
- Build dashboards and narratives to communicate performance and insights to leadership; recommend actions with clarity and urgency.
- Manage agencies and contractors where needed; document playbooks, uphold best practices, and continuously improve tooling and processes.
- Ensure privacy and compliance by design (e.g., GDPR/CCPA, consent management) and uphold high standards for security and governance.

### What You Bring
- 5+ years of hands-on growth marketing experience in tech or high-growth environments; track record of delivering measurable impact.
- Strength in at least two areas: paid acquisition, SEO/ASO, lifecycle/CRM, CRO/landing pages, referral/affiliate, or product-led growth.
- Proficiency with analytics and experimentation: GA4 and Amplitude/Mixpanel, SQL for analysis, and sound understanding of statistical concepts.
- Practical experience with attribution and campaign management: Segment/CDP, Braze/Iterable/Marketo/HubSpot, Google Ads/Meta Ads/LinkedIn, AppsFlyer/Adjust/Branch.
- Proficiency with cohort analysis, LTV/CAC modeling, and budget forecasting; strong spreadsheet modeling skills; familiarity with Looker/Tableau/Mode is a plus.
- Excellent communication and collaboration skills; can synthesize insights and influence cross-functional partners.
- Bias for action, ownership mindset, and high standards for quality, privacy, and user experience.

### Nice to Have
- Experience in fintech, healthcare, privacy-sensitive, or other compliance-heavy domains.
- Experience with MMM and incrementality methodologies; familiarity with media mix modeling and geo-testing.
- Familiarity with data stacks (BigQuery/Snowflake, dbt) and reverse ETL (Hightouch/Census).
- Basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript for rapid landing page iteration; experience with Webflow or similar tools.
- Experience with international growth, localization, and multi-region campaign operations.
- Meaningful open-source contributions or thought leadership.

### How We Work
- Product-minded engineering: we start with user problems, iterate quickly, and measure outcomes.
- Engineering excellence: clear APIs and contracts, design docs before complex work, code reviews focused on clarity and maintainability.
- Security and privacy by design: threat modeling, least-privilege defaults, automated checks in CI, and regular reviews.
- Pragmatism: choose the simplest approach that can scale; optimize for developer velocity and long-term maintainability.

### Compensation & Benefits
- Competitive salary and meaningful equity (RSUs/stock options).
- Comprehensive health, dental, and vision coverage; mental health support.
- Flexible time off and paid parental leave.
- Top-tier tooling and ergonomic workspace support.
- Annual learning budget and dedicated time for professional development.

### Equal Opportunity
