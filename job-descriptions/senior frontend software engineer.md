### What You Will Do
- Deliver delightful, accessible, and responsive web experiences using React and TypeScript.
- Lead frontend architecture: routing, state management, data fetching and caching, SSR/SSG, and build pipelines.
- Collaborate with backend engineers to shape API contracts and integration patterns; enforce consistent types and runtime validation.
- Own features end-to-end: technical discovery, implementation, testing, observability, rollout, and post-launch iteration.
- Establish performance and UX standards.
- Build and maintain a design system and component library with strong theming and accessibility guarantees.
- Introduce best practices for performance, testing, security, and developer experience.
- Mentor engineers, lead projects, and collaborate across disciplines.

### What You Bring
- 5+ years of professional software engineering experience, including end-to-end product ownership.
- Fluency with modern web frontend engineering: component-driven development, JavaScript/TypeScript, performance profiling, and accessibility; deep experience with React.
- Hands-on experience integrating with production-grade services and APIs (REST/gRPC/GraphQL).
- Expertise with frontend data and architecture: React Server Components/SSR, data fetching and caching, routing, forms, and error boundaries.
- Strong testing mindset and practice and familiarity with feature flags and safe rollouts.
- Experience with performance tooling and delivery: Lighthouse/WebPageTest, bundle analysis, code splitting, image optimization, CDN/edge delivery, and CI/CD.
- Familiarity collaborating with backend teams.
- Experience with cloud environments (AWS/GCP/Azure), containers, orchestration (Kubernetes), and CI/CD.
- Security-first thinking and familiarity with secure coding practices.
- Excellent communication, ownership, and a bias for action in ambiguous, fast-moving environments.

### Nice to Have
- Web platform depth: Next.js, Vite, TanStack Router/Query, CSS-in-JS or utility-first CSS, Web Vitals optimization.
- Mobile depth: Flutter performance tuning and shared design systems across web/mobile; experience shipping to iOS/Android/macOS/Windows.
- Observability: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus/Grafana, Sentry, Datadog; pragmatic on-call and SLO mentality.
- Infrastructure-as-Code, networking fundamentals, zero-downtime deployments.
- Prior experience in high-scale, low-latency systems, fintech/health/privacy domains, or compliance-heavy environments.
- Meaningful open-source contributions or technical writing/talks.

### How We Work
- Product-minded engineering: we start with user problems, iterate quickly, and measure outcomes.
- Engineering excellence: clear APIs and contracts, design docs before complex work, code reviews focused on clarity and maintainability.
- Security and privacy by design: threat modeling, least-privilege defaults, automated checks in CI, and regular reviews.
- Pragmatism: choose the simplest approach that can scale; optimize for developer velocity and long-term maintainability.

### Compensation & Benefits
- Competitive salary and meaningful equity (RSUs/stock options).
- Comprehensive health, dental, and vision coverage; mental health support.
