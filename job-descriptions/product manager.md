### Product Manager

**Location**: San Francisco
**Employment**: Full-time

### About the Role
We are looking for Product Managers to lead cross-functional teams in building products that customers love and that move our business forward. You will define the strategy and roadmap, drive discovery and execution, and measure outcomes to ensure we are solving the most important problems with high quality and velocity. You will collaborate closely with engineering, design, data, and go-to-market partners to deliver fast, reliable, and secure experiences across web and mobile.

### What You Will Do
- Define and communicate a clear product vision, strategy, and roadmap aligned with company goals.
- Drive product discovery through user research, data analysis, and competitive insights to identify opportunities, clarify problem statements, and define success metrics.
- Translate insights into well-scoped PRDs with crisp requirements, acceptance criteria, and milestones; partner with engineering and design to plan, sequence, and ship value incrementally.
- Partner with design to deliver delightful, accessible, and performant experiences; ensure usability, accessibility, and consistency across surfaces.
- Own the end-to-end lifecycle: technical discovery, implementation planning, QA and rollout, go-to-market coordination, measurement, and iteration.
- Instrument, monitor, and analyze product performance using dashboards and experiments to validate hypotheses and improve outcomes.
- Maintain a high quality bar for reliability, security, and privacy-by-design in collaboration with engineering.
- Manage stakeholders proactively with transparent communication of priorities, timelines, risks, and decisions.
- Run effective product rituals (backlog grooming, sprint planning, reviews, retros) and continuously improve team processes and developer experience.

### What You Bring
- 5+ years of product management experience shipping user-facing products end-to-end.
- Demonstrated track record delivering both 0→1 and 1→N iterations that achieved measurable business and user impact.
- Strong analytical and problem-solving skills; comfortable defining metrics, writing queries, and making data-informed decisions.
- Excellence in written and verbal communication; ability to create clarity, drive alignment, and influence across functions and levels.
- Experience working closely with engineering and design in modern product development practices (agile, RFCs/design docs, feature flags, experimentation).
- Customer-first mindset with deep user empathy and the ability to synthesize qualitative and quantitative insights.
- Familiarity with web/mobile ecosystems, APIs/platform products, and the software development lifecycle.

### Nice to Have
- Background in high-scale, reliability-sensitive, or compliance-heavy domains.
- Experience with developer products, APIs, or data/analytics tools.
- Comfort with technical concepts and collaborating on technical tradeoffs.
- Experience leading cross-functional launches with marketing, sales, and support.

### How We Work
- Product-minded engineering: we start with user problems, iterate quickly, and measure outcomes.
- Engineering excellence: clear APIs and contracts, design docs before complex work, code reviews focused on clarity and maintainability.
- Security and privacy by design: threat modeling, least-privilege defaults, automated checks in CI, and regular reviews.
- Pragmatism: choose the simplest approach that can scale; optimize for developer velocity and long-term maintainability.

### Compensation & Benefits
- Competitive salary and meaningful equity (RSUs/stock options).
- Comprehensive health, dental, and vision coverage; mental health support.
- Flexible time off and paid parental leave.
- Top-tier tooling and ergonomic workspace support.
- Annual learning budget and dedicated time for professional development.

### Equal Opportunity
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We are committed to providing reasonable accommodations for candidates with disabilities throughout the interview process.
